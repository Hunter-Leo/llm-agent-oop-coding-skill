description: Guides LLM agents through large-scale coding tasks using a spec-driven, phase-by-phase methodology covering requirement definition, planning, algorithm design, and implementation with OOP principles and language-specific coding standards. Use when starting a new software project, implementing a complex feature, refactoring existing code, or when you need a disciplined step-by-step approach to any non-trivial coding task.

# Spec Coding Skill

A spec-driven methodology for LLM agents to define, plan, and implement large-scale coding work with quality and consistency.

## When Activated

1. **Read [00-agent-execution.md](references/00-agent-execution.md) first** — these are global rules that apply to every phase and take precedence over all other instructions
2. **Start Phase 01** — follow [01-initialization.md](references/01-initialization.md) to create the requirement definition document
3. **Work through phases in order** — consult the reference file for each phase as you enter it

All generated documents go under `.dev/[NNN]-[req-name]/` in the project root.

## Phase Overview

```
Phase 01 — Initialization              (required)
              ↓
Phase 02 — Prerequisite Tasks          (optional, LLM judges)
Phase 03 — Algorithm Design            (optional, LLM judges)
              ↓
Phase 04 — Implementation Plan         (required)
              ↓
Phase 05 — Task Planning               (required)
              ↓
Phase 06 — Create start-and-resume.md  (required)
              ↓
Phase 07 — Execution                   (required)
```

Phases 02 and 03 are independent — both, one, or neither may be needed.

| Topic | Reference |

## Core Rules

- Never skip a required phase
- Read existing code before modifying anything
- Write and pass unit tests before moving to the next task
- Minimize changes when the project is `live`; breaking changes are allowed for `pre-launch` + new modules
- Never hardcode secrets; use environment variables
- All identifiers, comments, and docs must be in English
